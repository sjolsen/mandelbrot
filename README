This project may be built for Stampede using Makefile.stamp. Building
and running requires that the following commands be issued beforehand:

	module load cuda module swap mvapich2 impi

The project also depends on png++, which is not installed on
Stampede. This may be worked around by installing it locally:

	wget http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/pngpp/png++-0.2.5.tar.gz
	tar -xf png++-0.2.5.tar.gz
	cd png++-0.2.5
        make PREFIX=/path/to/mandelbrot
	install

This will install the necessary headers in ~/include. Before they can
be used, they need to be added to the include path:

	export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH="$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH:/path/to/mandelbrot"
	make all

Submission scripts are provided which invoke the program with various
thread counts, file sizes, and anti-aliasing levels at a fixed
viewpoint. The viewpoint may be modified by editing seahorse.bash, or
by invoking the program directly. Invoking with fewer than two
arguments causes the invocation rules to be displayed. Source code is
maintained as a git repository at:

	http://www.github.com/sjolsen/mandelbrot
